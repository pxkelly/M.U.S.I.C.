# M.U.S.I.C.

M.U.S.I.C. stands for Malleable User-Created Synth Instant Creator. Basically, it's a tool that allows you to create and edit a synthesizer in a simple and accessible way. This tool was created as the final project for Professor Carter's Music 270 class at Hamilton College by Peter Kelly  

You can find the actual application here: http://pxkelly.github.io/MUSIC  

M.U.S.I.C. uses the [Tone.js audio library](https://tonejs.github.io/) and was built to be a simple, accessible, and fun way to experiment with creating a synthesizer.  

It is tested to work on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. The app uses the keyboard, so unfortunately mobile phones are not supported.  

### Have fun!
